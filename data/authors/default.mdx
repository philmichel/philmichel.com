I am a Distinguished Engineer / Scientist / Technical Advisor in AI / ML at [GM / Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com), prior to which I ran robot perception and motion planning teams at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com). Before that, I led machine learning efforts at [Toyota Research Institute](https:/www.tri.global) and [Toyota Motor Corporation](https://global.toyota/en) and worked as a senior roboticist at [Google](https://www.google.com) / [X](https://www.solveforx.com/).

In a prior life, I was an equity derivatives trader at [Goldman Sachs](http://www.gs.com) in Tokyo, Japan for 7 years, trading volatility both "old-school" as well as algorithmically.

I hold a Ph.D. in robotics from Carnegie Mellon's [Robotics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu) as well as BA / MA degrees in computer science from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk).
